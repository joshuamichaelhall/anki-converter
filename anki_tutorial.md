# Anki Tutorial for Beginners

## What is Anki?

Anki is a powerful digital flashcard application that uses spaced repetition to help you remember information more efficiently. Instead of reviewing all your cards every day, Anki schedules reviews based on how well you know each card, showing difficult cards more frequently and easy cards less often.

## Getting Started

### 1. Download and Install

1. Visit the [Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to download the application for your device (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, or Android)
2. Install the application following the standard installation process for your operating system
3. Launch Anki once installation is complete

### 2. Understanding the Anki Interface

When you first open Anki, you'll see the main screen with these elements:

- **Decks**: Collections of flashcards organized by topic
- **Add**: Button to create new flashcards
- **Browse**: View and edit your existing cards
- **Stats**: View statistics about your studying progress
- **Sync**: Synchronize your cards across devices (requires free account)

### 3. Creating Your First Deck

1. Click the **Create Deck** button at the bottom of the main screen
2. Enter a name for your deck (e.g., "Spanish Vocabulary" or "Biology Terms")
3. Click **OK**

### 4. Adding Cards

1. Select your newly created deck
2. Click the **Add** button at the top of the screen
3. You'll see a form with "Front" and "Back" fields:
   - **Front**: The question or prompt (e.g., "What is photosynthesis?")
   - **Back**: The answer (e.g., "The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy")
4. Fill in both fields and click **Add**
5. Continue adding cards as needed

### 5. Importing Cards

To import cards from a text file:

1. Click **File** → **Import**
2. Select your file (CSV, TSV, or text file)
3. Configure import settings:
   - Select the appropriate note type (usually "Basic")
   - Set the correct field separator (comma, tab, etc.)
   - Map the columns to Anki fields (e.g., first column → Front, second column → Back)
4. Click **Import**

### 6. Studying

1. From the main screen, click on your deck
2. Click the **Study Now** button
3. For each card, you'll see the front side first
4. Try to recall the answer
5. Click **Show Answer** to see if you were correct
6. Rate your performance using the buttons:
   - **Again**: You didn't remember (short interval)
   - **Hard**: You remembered with difficulty (medium interval)
   - **Good**: You remembered correctly (longer interval)
   - **Easy**: You remembered easily (even longer interval)

### 7. Understanding the Spaced Repetition System

- Cards you find difficult will appear more frequently
- Cards you know well will appear less frequently
- The intervals between reviews will increase as you consistently answer correctly
- This system optimizes your study time by focusing on what you're most likely to forget

## Advanced Features

### Tags

Tags help organize cards across different decks:

1. When adding a card, enter tags in the "Tags" field (separate multiple tags with spaces)
2. Use the **Browse** function to search and filter by tags

### Card Types

Anki supports different card types:

- **Basic**: Simple front and back
- **Basic (and reversed)**: Creates two cards—one with the question on front, another with the answer on front
- **Cloze deletion**: Text with blanks to fill in

To create a cloze deletion:
1. Select the "Cloze" note type when adding a card
2. Write your text and select the word(s) to hide
3. Click the **[...]** button or use Ctrl+Shift+C to create a cloze deletion

### Using Images and Audio

1. While editing a card, click the paperclip icon
2. Select your image or audio file
3. It will be inserted into your card

### Add-ons

Enhance Anki with community-created add-ons:

1. Click **Tools** → **Add-ons** → **Get Add-ons**
2. Enter the add-on code (found on the Anki website)
3. Restart Anki when prompted

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Study daily**: Short, regular sessions are more effective than cramming
2. **Keep cards simple**: One question/concept per card
3. **Use images**: Visual memory can be powerful
4. **Create your own cards**: The process of creating cards aids learning
5. **Customize scheduling**: Adjust options if default intervals aren't working for you
6. **Sync regularly**: Keep your collection backed up and available across devices

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Sync conflicts**: If you get a sync conflict, choose the version with the most recent changes
- **Performance issues**: Optimize images, close unnecessary programs, or update Anki
- **Lost progress**: Use the backup feature (File → Switch Profile → Open Backup)

## Next Steps

As you become more comfortable with Anki, explore:
- Shared decks from the Anki community
- Custom note types for specialized content
- Advanced card styling with HTML and CSS
- Mobile apps for studying on the go

Remember, Anki is most effective when used consistently. Even 10-15 minutes of daily practice can lead to significant improvements in retention!
